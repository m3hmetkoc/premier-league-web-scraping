## Overview

I've just made a fun little web scraping project. I scraped Premier League teams' BTTS win rate data from a website using an object-oriented approach. Also, scraped premier league teams' hex color codes from the official website of the premier league.  After extracting the data, I visualized it.

## Key Topics

* Web Scraping: Utilized Selenium and Beautiful Soup to fetch data efficiently.

* Data Management: Employed Pandas to organize and store the scraped data in a CSV file.

* Visualization: Leveraged Matplotlib to create insightful visualizations for better understanding.

Here you can find the links of the websites.
